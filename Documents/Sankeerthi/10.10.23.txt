Progress Report

Key Points:
•	What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a technology that is used to store data in a decentralized and distributed manner. The term was first coined by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and it has only been growing since then.
Blockchain has many applications and one of the most popular ones is in cryptocurrency. 

•	Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset. It is used as a mode of trading to buy and sell just like money. Today there are many kinds of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, NFT, etc.

•	How are blockchain and cryptocurrency linked?
Just like how data can be stored on the blockchain network, transactions too can be made and the transaction history is stored.
This way there is no involvement of a 3rd party organization (like banks) in transactions. The user would have full control over his/her money. How is this advantageous? The elimination of 
third-party organizations also eliminates the burden of taxes and makes transactions easier and quicker. Is it safe? Absolutely. This is because the network is distributed i.e. your 
transaction history is duplicated and the copy is stored by many other people on the network hence making it easier to detect any frauds.

•	Ledger
A general ledger is simply a record-keeping system for financial data, whether it belongs to a company, an organization, a family, or an individual. 
It’s also known as a principal book of accounts and is composed of multiple general ledger accounts. Information used to create a ledger includes financial statements. Transactions are recorded as credit or debit.

 
•	Blocks in a blockchain
The blockchain has multiple blocks where each block stores some data and every block is linked to another through a method of hash and pre-hash. Hash is a unique ID that is
generated for each block that is added to the blockchain. One of the key features of the hash is it has a certain number of preceding zeroes. The hash of one block is stored 
in the pre-hash of the adjacent block and this is how the chain is created. It is due to these hashes and pre-hashes that if the data in one block is altered then a new hash is
generated for the block and because the chain is broken the new hash and the pre-hash of the adjacent block don’t match.

•	Nonce 
A nonce is a value or a number that can only be used once. Cryptographic hash algorithms and authentication protocols frequently employ nonces. An artificially
generated number used as a counter during the mining process is known as a nonce in the context of blockchain technology.

•	Mining
Mining is not just a means to make money. In a specific sense, mining involves the issuing of new coins. It is a process that powers the decentralized blockchain.
It is used to validate new transactions. It refers to adding large transactions to the large distributed public ledger of existing transactions. Mining is important because
it prevents fraud. This is because the transactions are added to the chain/block only after validation. 

•	Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are basically blocks of codes that can be written by anyone and added to the blockchain network. Every smart contract that is being deployed on a blockchain network requires a certain number of coins.
